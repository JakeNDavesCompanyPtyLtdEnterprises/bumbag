# Blockquote

## Import

`import { Blockquote } from 'fannypack'`

## Basic Usage

`<Blockquote>` renders a `<blockquote>` element with reset styles and a left border.

<Playground>
  <Blockquote>
    <Paragraph marginBottom="major-2">"Out here, survival is the name of the game. Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."</Paragraph>
    <Text use="cite">- Russell Coight</Text>
  </Blockquote>
  <Blockquote backgroundColor="whitesmoke" marginTop="major-2">
    <Paragraph marginBottom="major-2">"Out here, survival is the name of the game. Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."</Paragraph>
    <Text use="cite">- Russell Coight</Text>
  </Blockquote>
</Playground>

## Border styling

The left border can be modified using the primitive style props:

<Playground>
  <Blockquote borderColor="blue">
    <Paragraph marginBottom="major-2">"Out here, survival is the name of the game. Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."</Paragraph>
    <Text use="cite">- Russell Coight</Text>
  </Blockquote>
</Playground>

Or you can hide the border:

<Playground>
  <Blockquote border="none">
    <Paragraph marginBottom="major-2">"Out here, survival is the name of the game. Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."</Paragraph>
    <Text use="cite">- Russell Coight</Text>
  </Blockquote>
</Playground>

## Props

<PropsTable component={Blockquote} />
