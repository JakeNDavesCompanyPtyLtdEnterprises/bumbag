# Usage with form libraries

Fannypack provides you with field adaptors for the React form libraries [Formik]() and [Redux Form]() to allow for 'built-in' state & validation rendering instead of you doing it yourself with their metadata.

## Formik

To use Fannypack fields with Formik, import the `formikField` adaptor and create a Formik field component with it. Then use your field component with Formik's `<Field>`.

> Note: You must create the field outside of your component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Formik, Form, Field } from 'formik';
import { InputField, formikField } from 'fannypack';

const FormikInputField = formikField(InputField);

function Form() {
  return (
    <Formik initialValues={{ username: '' }} handleSubmit={data => console.log(data)}>
      <Form>
        <Field component={FormikInputField} name="username" label="Username" />
      </Form>
    </Formik>
  );
}

export default Form;
```

## Redux Form

To use Fannypack fields with Redux Form, import the `reduxFormField` adaptor and create a Redux Form field component with it. Then use your field component with Redux Form's `<Field>`.

> Note: You must create the field outside of your component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { reduxForm, Field } from 'redux-form';
import { InputField, reduxFormField } from 'fannypack';

const ReduxFormInputField = reduxFormField(InputField);

function Form() {
  return (
    <form>
      <Field component={ReduxFormInputField} name="username" label="Username" />
    </form>
  );
}

export default reduxForm({ form: 'addUsername' })(Form);
```
