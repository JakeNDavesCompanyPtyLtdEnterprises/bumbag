# Portal

## Import

`import { Portal } from 'fannypack'`

## Basic Usage

The `<Portal>` component is built with [React Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) and is useful for instances where the component needs to be detached from the main DOM tree, and placed adjacent to it in it's own `<div>`.

<Playground>
  <Portal textAlign="center">I am on the bottom of the page</Portal>
</Playground>

## Props

<PropsTable component={Portal} />

## Theming

### Schema

```jsx
{
  Portal: {
    base: css | Object
  }
}
```
