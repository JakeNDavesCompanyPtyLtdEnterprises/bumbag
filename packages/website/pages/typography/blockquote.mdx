# Blockquote

### Import

```jsx
import { Blockquote } from 'fannypack'
```

### Basic Usage

`<Blockquote>` renders a `<blockquote>` element with reset styles and a left border.

```.jsx
<Blockquote>
  <Paragraph marginBottom="major-2">
    "Out here, survival is the name of the game.
    Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."
  </Paragraph>
  <Text use="cite">- Russell Coight</Text>
</Blockquote>
<Blockquote backgroundColor="whitesmoke" marginTop="major-2">
  <Paragraph marginBottom="major-2">
    "Out here, survival is the name of the game.
    Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."
  </Paragraph>
  <Text use="cite">- Russell Coight</Text>
</Blockquote>
```

### Border styling

The left border can be modified using the primitive style props:

```.jsx
<Blockquote borderColor="blue">
  <Paragraph marginBottom="major-2">
    "Out here, survival is the name of the game.
    Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."
  </Paragraph>
  <Text use="cite">- Russell Coight</Text>
</Blockquote>
```

Or you can hide the border:

```.jsx
<Blockquote border="none">
  <Paragraph marginBottom="major-2">
    "Out here, survival is the name of the game.
    Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."
  </Paragraph>
  <Text use="cite">- Russell Coight</Text>
</Blockquote>
```

### Props

<PropsTable component={Blockquote} />

### Theming

#### Schema

```jsx
{
  Blockquote: {
    base: css | Object
  }
}
```
